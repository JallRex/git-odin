        <h1>My <strong>third</strong> h1 heading!! :o</h1>
        <p>Below are ordered lists -ol- and unordered lists -ul- both use -li- as elements</p>
        
        <ol>Ordered list -ol- with -li-:
            <li>Item 1 in ordered list!</li>
            <li>Item 2 in ordered list!</li>
            <li>Item 3 in ordered list!</li>

    <div>
        <p>Links!</p>
        <a href="../html-boilerplate/pages/about.html">Click me!</a>
        <p>The above link is made with -a- anchor tags. Inside the first <br>
        -a- there is a href element that equals the filename for site two. <br>
        (both are bundled in the same folder, so it works!)</p>
        <p><br><br><strong>Absolute links are direct full links to external sites. <br>
        Relative links are links to "internal" sites (sites on your own site)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Images!</p>

        <img src="../html-boilerplate/images/dog.jpg" alt="Dog picture" width="120" height="150">

        <p>Above there should be a dog, he is saved in the local folder along pages. <br>
        I retreived him by using img src (img <em>Source</em>) = link to doggy -img- <br>
        Also, you will need to add and -alt- as an alternative for image. <br><br>
        Scaling the picture can be done with width and height inside the tag.</p>
